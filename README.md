## For each of the dataset, below are the questions we are hoping to answer using predictive model.

a) Youtube trending Video
- Perform analysis of trending videos by each feature (category, Tags, Likes, comments,title etc.). Use Machine learning models to predict What features could make a video trending on YouTube. 
- Using USA country dataset

b) Travel insurance 
- Predict whether consumers would prefer to buy travel insurance post pandemic?

c) Reading Habits
- Predict Reading habits(Genre or type of book) based on demographic details and education details if there is a significant change in demographic+education details, will that impact the reading habits of the population

d) Retail Dataset
-  Predict whether retail stores would still be sustainable business model with digitization taking the lead across the globe.

e) House Sales
- Predict the pricing/ buying pattern based on features of the house

f) Vehicle fuel type
- With the advent of EV, predict the future of fuel based vehicles by location
